# LeoBook Developer RuleBook v9.5.7

> **This document is LAW.** Every developer and AI agent working on LeoBook MUST follow these rules without exception. Violations will break the system.

---

## 1. First Principles

Before writing ANY code, ask in this exact order:

1. **Question** — Is this feature/change actually needed? What problem does it solve?
2. **Delete** — Can existing code be removed instead of adding more?
3. **Simplify** — What is the simplest possible implementation?
4. **Accelerate** — Can this run concurrently or be parallelized?
5. **Automate** — Can Leo.py orchestrate this without human intervention?

**Summary of First Principles Thinking** - **Question** every requirements and make it less dumb and **delete** those that are dumb and useless(no "incase-we-need-it" ideology), then **simplify**, **accelerate** and **automate** all those that remain. This is MUSK do, throughout the entire **LeoBook** codebase — local and cloud.

---

## 2. Backend Architecture (Python)

### 2.1 Leo.py Is an Autonomous Orchestrator

- **`Leo.py` is an AUTONOMOUS ORCHESTRATOR** — it contains ZERO business logic.
- It is powered by a **Supervisor-Worker Pattern** (`Core/System/supervisor.py`).
- Chapter/page execution functions (`run_chapter_1_p1`, `run_prologue_p2`, etc.) live in `Core/System/pipeline.py` — NOT in `Leo.py`.
- Every script MUST be callable via `Leo.py` CLI flags.
- **Cycle Control**: The `Supervisor` decides when to wake up based on `scheduler`. Monolithic `while True` loops are forbidden.

### 2.2 Startup Bootstrapping (MANDATORY)

Every entry point (`main()`) MUST call `await run_startup_sync()`. This function ensures:
1. SQLite → Supabase **push-only sync** (only local rows modified since last watermark are pushed — ZERO reads from Supabase).
2. Auto-bootstrap: if local DB is empty, pulls all data from Supabase (one-time).
3. Local database and Supabase table existence.
Operations MUST NOT start (including live streamer) until startup sync completes successfully.

**Default sync mode**: `sync_on_startup()` uses **delta detection by default** (`force_full=False`). Only rows modified since the last watermark are pushed. A full push only happens during bootstrap (empty local DB). Never set `force_full=True` at startup — it caused a 44s penalty pushing 108k rows on every restart.

**Manual recovery**: `python Leo.py --pull` pulls ALL data from Supabase → local SQLite.

**Sync runs ONLY in Ch1 P3** (Final Sync). Ch1 P1 and Ch1 P2 do NOT sync — sync is consolidated to end of pipeline.

### 2.3 Data Readiness Gates (Prologue)

Leo.py operates via three sequential gates to ensure data integrity:

1. **Prologue P1 (Quantity & ID Gate)**: Leagues >= 90% coverage AND Teams >= 3 per league (v7.1). Validates Flashscore IDs — fails if invalid ID rate > 5%. GapScanner feeds this gate: P1 fails if `critical` gap count across `leagues` or `teams` tables exceeds threshold. **No default auto-enrichment**: operators normally run explicit `python Leo.py --enrich-leagues` (and related flags). **Opt-in only**: `python Leo.py --prologue --prologue-p1-enrich` (when Prologue P1 runs) may trigger **one** active-window Flashscore enrichment pass if gates fail — see `Core/System/pipeline.py`.
2. **Prologue P2 (Flashscore extraction)**: Runs only when P1 passes. **Dual-sport**: separate active-window refresh passes for **football** and **basketball** Flashscore URLs (`infer_flashscore_sport` on `leagues.url`). Each pass uses ±**14 days** (same as `--enrich-leagues --refresh`). **Priority**: fb-mapped leagues first within each sport (`Core/System/prologue_extraction.py` → `fs_league_enricher`).
3. **Prologue P3 (football.com Phase 0 + basketball hub)**: Runs only when P1 passes. **Football**: no-login calendar/fixture discovery for mapped football leagues (`fb_phase0.py`), **14-day active** + `fb_url` first (football JSON rows only). **Basketball**: schedule-hub discovery + fixture extraction for basketball tournament links (`run_basketball_fb_prologue_phase0` in `prologue_extraction.py`), schedule-page order as active-first proxy.

### 2.3.1 Season / history quality (outside Prologue)

Historical season completeness, GapScanner **critical** gaps on `schedules`, and RL tier reporting remain available via `check_seasons_ready()` / `Core/System/data_readiness.py` and **do not** block the Prologue chain after P2/P3 redefinition. Use `--season-completeness`, `--data-quality`, or `--train-rl` explicitly when you need those jobs.

### 2.4 Strict Data Contract (v9.5.7)
- **All-or-Nothing Transactions**: Standardized in `Modules/Flashscore/data_contract.py`. Every worker MUST validate the full match payload before database ingress. Partial data is dropped.
- **Rich Rationale Serialization**: Intelligence outputs MUST include the reasoning chain (Form, H2H, Standings) as structured JSON in the `intelligence_context` column. Single-string reasoning is deprecated.
- **Season / schedule quality (data_readiness / GapScanner)**: `check_seasons_ready()` still distinguishes **Job A** (critical gaps + completed-season consistency) from **Job B** (RL tier: RULE_ENGINE / PARTIAL / FULL). These inform training and ensemble weighting; they are **not** the Prologue P2/P3 pages in `pipeline.py` (those are Flashscore + football.com extraction as in §2.3).

**Readiness Cache (Materialized)**:
- Gate checks MUST read from `readiness_cache` in the DB for O(1) lookup.
- The cache is updated after every successful scan or via `--bypass-cache` for forced re-scan.

**No auto-remediation (All-or-Nothing)**: Failed gates **do not** trigger enrichment or RL training automatically. Operators choose `python Leo.py --enrich-leagues`, `--refresh`, `--seasons`, `--train-rl`, etc. The scheduler may still run **scheduled** tasks (e.g. weekly enrichment, RL training jobs) when those tasks are queued — that is explicit scheduling, not implicit “fix the gate” behavior.

**Readiness cache schema versioning**: `data_readiness.py` tracks `_CACHE_SCHEMA_VERSION = "9.3"`. Any schema change MUST increment this constant — stale cache entries from older versions are silently cleared and a fresh scan runs. Update `_CACHE_SCHEMA_VERSION` in `Core/System/data_readiness.py` on every release.

### 2.5 Pipeline Structure (v8.0)

```
Startup Sync: Push-only (local → Supabase, auto-bootstrap if empty)
Task Scheduler: Execute pending tasks (Weekly Enrichment, predictions)
Prologue (Data Gates):
    P1: League/Team Thresholds (90% / 5 teams) — fed by GapScanner; optional --prologue-p1-enrich
    P2: Flashscore active-window extraction per sport (football + basketball, ±14 days, fb-mapped first) — gated on P1
    P3: football.com Phase 0 (football) + basketball hub fixture discovery — gated on P1
Chapter 1 (via Core/System/pipeline.py):
    P1: URL Resolution & Odds Harvesting (v9.0 — Direct Harvesting, no login)
        - SearchDict runs INSIDE fb_manager.py, post-resolution, once per league batch.
          It is NOT a pipeline step — do not print "SearchDict skipped" in pipeline.py.
    P2: Prediction Pipeline (30-dim Stairway Engine — Rule Engine + Poisson RL)
        - DATA LEAK GUARD: Max 1 prediction per team per week.
          This prevents the model from using future match data to predict
          earlier matches. A team's next match can only be predicted once
          their most recent match result is known.
        - Surplus matches are queued as 'day_before_predict' tasks.
    P3: Final Recommendations & Sync (Stairway Gate: 1.20–4.00 odds)
        - Per (sport, day) picks, then **one daily Stairway slip** per calendar day (merged sports):
          greedy legs within odds band, combined odds cap — `Scripts/recommend_bets.py` → `stairway_daily_slips.json`.
        - **Recommender → predictor hook**: `recommender_predictor_hint.json` (league EMA) nudges Ch1 P2 confidence when present (`prediction_pipeline.py`).
Chapter 2:
    P1: Automated Booking (Football.com)
    P2: Funds & Withdrawal Check
Live Streamer: Isolated parallel task — Live Scores + Outcome Review + Accuracy Reports
```

### 2.6 Standings Table Is FORBIDDEN

- **Rule**: No persistent `standings` table allowed in SQLite or Supabase.
- **Implementation**: Standings MUST be computed on-the-fly via the `computed_standings` VIEW in Supabase or `computed_standings()` in `league_db.py`.
- **Reasoning**: Ensures zero-latency source-of-truth accuracy and removes redundant sync overhead.

### 2.7 File Headers (MANDATORY)

Every Python file MUST have this header format:

```python
# filename.py: One-line description of what this file does.
# Part of LeoBook <Component> — <Sub-component>
#
# Functions: func1(), func2(), func3()
# Called by: Leo.py (Chapter X Page Y) | other_module.py
```

### 2.8 No Dead Code

- No commented-out code blocks
- No unused imports
- No functions that are never called

### 2.9 Concurrency Rules

- **Max Concurrency**: strictly limited by `MAX_CONCURRENCY` in `.env`.
- **Sequential Integrity**: Inside each match worker, steps must remain SEQUENTIAL.
- **SQLite WAL**: Handles concurrent access. Never use manual locks for DB operations.
- **Live Streamer Isolation**: Streamer runs in its own Playwright instance with an isolated user data directory.

### 2.10 Timezone Consistency (Africa/Lagos)

- **Rule**: Every timestamp MUST use the Nigerian timezone (**Africa/Lagos**, UTC+1).
- **Tooling**: Use `Core.Utils.constants.now_ng()` for all time operations.
- **Rationale**: Football.com operates exclusively in Nigeria/Ghana (WAT timezone). Developer location is WAT. Cross-league timezone normalization (UTC/CET for European leagues) is planned but deferred to avoid complexity during current testing phase.
- **Edge case**: European daylight saving transitions may cause 1-hour misalignment in match time parsing during DST transition weeks.

### 2.11 High-Velocity Data Ingestion (Selective Enrichment)

- **Rule**: When dealing with massive datasets (>1,000 leagues), developers and agents SHOULD use **selective enrichment** via range limits and season targeting.
- **Implementation**:
    - Use `--limit START-END` to process specific chunks of the league list.
    - Use `--season N` to target the most recent historical season (N=1) rather than multiple seasons at once.
- **Reasoning**: Prevents memory exhaustion in constrained environments (e.g., Codespaces) and allows for distributed processing if multiple LeoBook instances are run in parallel.

### 2.12 Selector Compliance (Zero Hardcoded Selectors)

- **Rule**: ALL CSS selectors used for web scraping MUST be defined in `Config/knowledge.json` and accessed via `Core.Intelligence.selector_manager.SelectorManager`. **Zero hardcoded selectors** in Python or JavaScript code files.
- **Implementation**:
    - Define selectors under the appropriate context key in `knowledge.json` (e.g., `fs_league_page`, `fs_match_page`).
    - In Python, use `selector_mgr.get_all_selectors_for_context(CONTEXT)` to retrieve the full selector dict.
    - In JS evaluation, pass the selectors dict as an argument and reference keys (e.g., `s.breadcrumb_links`, `s.match_link`).
- **Reasoning**: Flashscore frequently changes class names and DOM structure. Centralizing selectors in one JSON file makes updates fast and auditable.

### 2.13 Data Quality & Invalid ID Resolution

- **Scanner**: `Data/Access/gap_scanner.py` (`GapScanner`) scans all three core tables — `leagues`, `teams`, `schedules` — at the individual cell level. Every gap is tracked to its originating `(league_id, season)` pair so enrichment is surgical, not wholesale.

- **Gap Severity Tiers** (canonical — used by GapScanner, Prologue gates, enrichment queue, and all documentation):
    - `critical` — blocks match resolution or prediction pipeline. Prologue P1/P2 will fail. Must fix before pipeline runs.
    - `important` — degrades app UX or crest display (e.g. missing team crests, `match_status`, `fs_league_id`). Should fix; does not block pipeline.
    - `enrichable` — nice to have; can be back-filled without a browser session (e.g. `time`, `league_stage`, `region_url`). Fix opportunistically.

- **Gap detection rules**:
    - `NULL` or empty string `""` → gap on all column types.
    - URL columns (`crest`, `home_crest`, `away_crest`, `region_url`) → any value not starting with `http` is a gap, including local paths (`Data/Store/...`).
    - Score columns (`home_score`, `away_score`) → NULL is allowed for `match_status = scheduled`; not a gap.

- **Crest URL integrity**:
    - Team and league crests MUST be Supabase Storage public URLs in all three tables. Local paths are never synced to Supabase DB.
    - `_backfill_schedule_crests()` runs immediately after every crest upload batch inside `extract_tab()` to propagate the Supabase URL from `teams.crest` into `schedules.home_crest` / `schedules.away_crest`.
    - `propagate_crest_urls()` runs before every 20% sync checkpoint AND at the end of every enrichment run as a final safety pass.

- **Invalid ID Detection**:
    - Patterns: `^[A-Z_]+$`, `UNKNOWN_*`, empty, or < 8 chars for teams.
    - Duplicates: Valid IDs overwrite placeholders; multiple valid rows are merged (dependency re-linking).

- **`enrichment_queue` priorities** (unchanged):
    - `Priority 1 (CRITICAL)`: Invalid IDs blocking remediation.
    - `Priority 5 (NORMAL)`: Missing metadata.
    - `Priority 10 (DEFERRED)`: Old season gaps.

- **CLI flags for gap-driven enrichment**:
    - `python -m Scripts.enrich_leagues` — default mode; runs GapScanner first, enriches only leagues/seasons with detected gaps.
    - `python -m Scripts.enrich_leagues --scan-only` — print gap report and exit without modifying data. Use for monitoring.
    - `python -m Scripts.enrich_leagues --min-severity critical` — only fix pipeline-blocking gaps.
    - `python -m Scripts.enrich_leagues --min-severity enrichable` — fix everything including minor columns.

### 2.14 Neuro-Symbolic Ensemble (Intelligence v8.0 "Stairway Engine")

- **Rule**: Predictions MUST combine Rule Engine (Symbolic) and RL (Neural) signals over a **30-dimensional action space**.
- **Action Space**: Defined in `Core/Intelligence/rl/market_space.py` (Single Source of Truth). Includes 1X2, DC, OU (1.5, 2.5, 3.5), BTTS, and no_bet.
- **Expert Signal**: Phase 1 uses a **Poisson-grounded signal** derived from xG (1.20 home / 0.82 away multiplier) as the ground truth for imitation learning.
- **Stairway Gate**: Final output must pass the odds gate (1.20 ≤ odds ≤ 4.00) and an EV-positive check before recommendation.
- **Weights**: Default `W_symbolic=0.7`, `W_neural=0.3`. Overridable per-league in `ensemble_weights.json`.
- **Season-Aware Scaling (v9.1)**: `W_neural` is scaled by `data_richness_score` [0.0, 1.0] per league. 0 prior seasons → `W_neural = 0.0` (pure Rule Engine). 3+ prior seasons → `W_neural = 0.3` (full weight). Prevents RL from influencing predictions for leagues with no training history.
- **Symbolic Baseline**: If `RL_Conf < 0.3` or model failure, fallback to `100% Rule Engine`. The system MUST NOT place bets based purely on low-confidence neural signals.
- **Phase guidance**: The Rule Engine is the reliability backbone throughout Phase 1. RL weights should only be increased beyond 0.3 after Phase 2 completes and RL accuracy on odds-grounded data is verified to exceed the Rule Engine baseline on high-volume days (≥ 200 matches).

### 2.15 Module Size Limit

**Rule**: All Python implementation files MUST remain ≤500 lines. When a file approaches 500 lines, split it using the established pattern: extract a sub-module, keep the original as a façade that re-exports everything.

- **Façade exemption**: A façade file whose body is primarily `from sub_module import ...` re-exports may exceed 500 lines — it contains no logic. Its sub-modules must each be ≤500 lines.
- Backward import compatibility is mandatory — no callers should need to change their imports.
- Monoliths are a maintenance liability and violate this rule.
- The initial modularisation (v9.1, 2026-03-14/15) split 9 files totalling 9,439 lines into 24 files all ≤500 lines.

Compliant split pattern:
```python
# Original: large_module.py (1,200L) → split into:
# large_module.py       (≤500L) — façade, re-exports everything
# large_module_schema.py (≤500L) — extracted schema/DDL
# large_module_helpers.py (≤500L) — extracted helpers
```

### 2.16 Module Home Rule

**Rule**: Files belong in the module that matches their concern:
- Flashscore scraping → `Modules/Flashscore/`
- Asset management → `Modules/Assets/`
- Football.com automation → `Modules/FootballCom/`
- Data access (SQLite/Supabase) → `Data/Access/`
- One-shot CLI tools → `Scripts/`
- System orchestration → `Core/System/`

`Scripts/` is a staging area, not a permanent home. If a script grows beyond a single concern, it MUST be moved to the appropriate module. The original path becomes a one-line shim for backward compatibility.

### 2.17 Reuse First: Proven Components Are Assets

**Rule**: Before writing ANY new component — scroll handler, collapse toggle, DB helper, image downloader — search the codebase first. Proven, battle-tested components **MUST** be reused and extended, not re-implemented.

**What to search for before building new:**
- Lazy-loading / scroll-to-load → `fs_league_hydration.py` (`_scroll_to_load`, `_expand_show_more`)
- Collapse/expand widgets → `Flutter: LeagueFixturesPanel` collapse logic
- SQLite CRUD helpers → `Data/Access/db_helpers.py`
- Image download + Supabase upload → `fs_league_images.py` (`schedule_image_download`, `upload_crest_to_supabase`)
- Country flag download → `Data/Access/logo_downloader.py`

**Reasoning**: Re-implementing proven components wastes time, introduces new bugs, and fragments the codebase. Every line of new code is a liability. Reuse is a force-multiplier.

### 2.18 Timezone: WAT Is the Backend Standard

**Rule**: All backend timestamps **MUST** be in WAT (`Africa/Lagos`, UTC+1).

- **Tooling**: Use `Core.Utils.constants.now_ng()` for all `datetime.now()` calls. Never call `datetime.now()` directly.
- **Playwright**: All browser sessions MUST use `timezone_id="Africa/Lagos"` in `new_context()`.
- **Supabase**: Timestamps pushed to Supabase are WAT ISO strings. The Flutter frontend handles timezone display conversion for the user.
- **Match times**: Raw Flashscore match times are scraped in WAT context. No UTC offset is applied at backend level.
- **Reasoning**: Football.com operates in Nigeria (WAT). Developer location is WAT. Consistent WAT throughout eliminates confusion and DST edge cases in the Nigerian market.

### 2.19 Streamer Process Management

**Rule**: `fs_live_streamer.py` runs as a fully independent OS process (`start_new_session=True`). It CANNOT be stopped by `Leo.py` or `Ctrl+C`. Use the platform command below.

**Linux / macOS / GitHub Codespaces:**
```bash
pkill -f fs_live_streamer
# Or: pgrep -fa fs_live_streamer → kill -9 <PID>
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
Get-WmiObject Win32_Process | Where-Object {$_.CommandLine -like "*fs_live_streamer*"} | ForEach-Object { taskkill /F /PID $_.ProcessId }
```

**Batch resume checkpoint**: `fb_manager.py` writes `Data/Logs/batch_checkpoint.json` after each completed batch. On restart, it skips already-completed batches for the current calendar day. Checkpoint is cleared at natural session end.

**Upsert batch sizes** (defined in `sync_schema._BATCH_SIZES`):
- `predictions`: 200 rows (prevents Supabase `statement_timeout` on 1,969-row single upsert)
- `schedules`: 500 rows
- `match_odds`: 1,000 rows
- All others: 2,000 rows (default)

**Schema type rules**: `paper_trades.league_id` MUST be `TEXT` — Flashscore league IDs are strings. If Supabase column was created as `INTEGER`, run: `ALTER TABLE public.paper_trades ALTER COLUMN league_id TYPE TEXT;`

---

## 3. Frontend Architecture (Flutter/Dart)

### 3.1 Constraints-Based Design (NO HARDCODED VALUES)

**The single most important rule:** Never use fixed `double` values (like `width: 300`) for layout-critical elements.

Use these widgets instead:
- `LayoutBuilder` — adapt widget trees based on parent `maxWidth`
- `Flexible` / `Expanded` — prevent overflow
- `FractionallySizedBox` — size as percentage
- `AspectRatio` — proportions
- `Responsive.sp(context, value)` — scaled spacing

### 3.2 Screens dispatch, Widgets render

Screens are pure dispatchers (`LayoutBuilder` / `Responsive.isDesktop()`). They contain ZERO rendering logic for components.

### 3.3 State Management

- Use `flutter_bloc` / `Cubit` exclusively.
- **NO RIVERPOD, NO GETX.**

### 3.4 App Versioning (Aligned with Leo.py)

- The Flutter app version in `leobookapp/pubspec.yaml` MUST match `LEOBOOK_VERSION` in `Core/Utils/constants.py`.
- Format: `version: X.Y.Z+N` where `X.Y` matches `LEOBOOK_VERSION` (e.g., `9.3` → `9.3.0+N`).
- The `+N` build number is Android's `versionCode` / iOS's `buildNumber` — it **MUST always increment** on every build. This is what enables upgrade installs without uninstalling the previous version.
- Example progression: `9.3.0+2` → `9.4.0+3` → `9.5.0+4` → `10.0.0+5`.

---

## 4. Maintenance & Verification

### 4.1 Weekly Enrichment (Monday 2:26 AM)

The scheduler MUST trigger `enrich_leagues.py --weekly` every Monday. This mode is lightweight (`MAX_SHOW_MORE=2`) and focuses on schedule updates and missing metadata.

Before enrichment runs, the scheduler MUST also invoke `enrich_leagues.py --scan-only` and persist the gap report to `readiness_cache`. This gives the Prologue gates an up-to-date gap count without triggering a full enrichment pass.

### 4.2 Before Every Commit

```bash
# Verify v8.0 Autonomous Loop
python Leo.py --help
python -c "from Core.System.scheduler import TaskScheduler; print('[OK]')"
python -c "from Core.System.data_readiness import DataReadinessChecker; print('[OK]')"
python -c "from Data.Access.gap_scanner import GapScanner; print('[OK]')"

# Verify Tier 1 guardrails are live
python -c "from Core.System.guardrails import StaircaseTracker; print('[OK]')"
```

## 6. 12-Step Problem-Solving Framework

> **MANDATORY** for all failure investigation and resolution. Follow in exact order.

| Step              | Action                    | Rule                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **1. Define**     | What is the problem?      | Focus on understanding — no blame.      |
| **2. Validate**   | Is it really a problem?   | Pause. Does this actually need solving? |
| **3. Expand**     | What else is the problem? | Look for hidden or related issues.      |
| **4. Trace**      | How did it occur?         | Reverse-engineer the timeline.          |
| **5. Brainstorm** | ALL possible solutions.   | No filtering yet.                       |
| **6. Evaluate**   | Best solution right now?  | Consider resources and time.            |
| **7. Decide**     | Commit to the solution.   | No second-guessing.                     |
| **8. Assign**     | Actionable steps.         | Systematic and specific.                |
| **9. Measure**    | Define "solved".          | Expected effects?                       |
| **10. Start**     | Take first action.        | Momentum matters.                       |
| **11. Complete**  | Finish every step.        | No half-measures.                       |
| **12. Review**    | Compare outcomes.         | Repeat if not solved.                   |

---

## 7. Decision-Making Standard

- **Sports Domain Accuracy**: Data MUST match the real-world source of truth.
- **Crest Integrity**: Team crests/logos MUST always be displayed alongside names. Crest columns in `schedules` MUST contain Supabase Storage URLs — never local paths.
- **No Hardcoded Proxy Data**: Never use placeholders (e.g., "WORLD"). Use "Unknown" if missing.
- **Sports-Informed Sorting**: Trust the database `position` column for standings.

---

## 8. Bet Safety Guardrails

> See [PROJECT_STAIRWAY.md](PROJECT_STAIRWAY.md) for the capital strategy and [LeoBook_Technical_Master_Report.md](LeoBook_Technical_Master_Report.md) Section 6 for the full guardrails specification.

All six Tier 1 guardrails are **LIVE as of March 10, 2026**. None may be disabled without an explicit Chief Engineer decision recorded in the audit log.

| Guardrail | Status | Implementation |
| --------- | ------ | -------------- |
| **Dry-Run Mode** | ✅ LIVE | `--dry-run` flag → `guardrails.enable_dry_run()` in `Leo.py`. Logs all intended bets without placing them. Default until full pipeline validation is complete. |
| **Kill Switch** | ✅ LIVE | `STOP_BETTING` flag file check in `fb_manager.py`. Creates an immediate halt of all bet placement when the file is present in the project root. |
| **Max Stake Cap** | ✅ LIVE | `StaircaseTracker.get_max_stake()` in `Core/Pages/placement.py`. Hard ceiling on stake per stair — cannot be overridden at runtime. |
| **Staircase State Machine** | ✅ LIVE | `StaircaseTracker` in `Core/System/guardrails.py`, persisted to SQLite `stairway_state` table. Enforces the one-stair fallback loss rule. State survives process restarts. |
| **Balance Sanity Check** | ✅ LIVE | Blocks all bet placement if account balance < ₦500. |
| **Daily Loss Limit** | ✅ LIVE | Halts all bet placement for the day if cumulative losses reach ₦5,000. Resets at midnight WAT. |

- **Audit Logging** (IMPLEMENTED): Every bet cycle writes to `audit_log` in both SQLite and Supabase.
- **Confidence Gating** (IMPLEMENTED): Predictions below threshold are marked `SKIP` and never progress to betting.

## 9. RULEBOOK Enforcement

- **Current**: This document is mandatory reading for all developers and AI agents. Compliance is honour-based.
- **Planned**: Pre-commit hooks and linter rules where automatable (e.g., SelectorManager usage, no hardcoded selectors, file headers).

## 10. CLI matrix (single-flag / primary entrypoints)

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--sync` / `--push` / `--pull` | Supabase ↔ SQLite sync |
| `--prologue` `[--page N]` `[--prologue-p1-enrich]` | Prologue chain |
| `--chapter N` `[--page N]` | Chapter 1–2 granular pages |
| `--enrich-leagues` | Flashscore enrichment (`fs_league_enricher`) |
| `--recommend` | Ch1 P3 recommendations + slip JSON |
| `--review` | Full outcome review (+ browser fallback) |
| `--bet-status` `[--fixture ID]` `[--date …]` | Narrow SQLite bet/prediction status (no browser) |
| `--fb-balance` `--user-id UUID` | Logged football.com balance |
| `--streamer` | Spawn live score streamer subprocess |
| `--train-rl` / `--diagnose-rl` | RL train / inspect |
| `--data-quality` | Gap scan + resolver utilities |

**Scrapers**: `(site, sport)` implementations are registered in `Core/Scrapers/registry.py` (`get_scraper`). **SQLite catalog**: canonical module is `Data/Access/league_db.py`; `Data/Access/sqlite_catalog.py` is a compatibility re-export.

**Session / streamer env (optional)**:

- `LEOBOOK_FB_PROXY`, `LEOBOOK_FB_USER_AGENT` — persistent football.com context (`fb_session.py`); operator/legal responsibility.
- `LEOBOOK_STREAMER_POLL_LIVE_SEC` — live-match poll interval (default 30s when live; idle uses 60s). DOM `MutationObserver` fast-path remains a future optional upgrade.
